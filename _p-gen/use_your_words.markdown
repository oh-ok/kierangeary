Use Your Words! is a 2D puzzle-platformer game in which you play as Ezra in their adventure through magic, the human psyche and relationships in order to understand the true power of using words in the right way. 

This is a concept project for the D&AD & Rare & Xbox "Games for Good" competition. Some of the contents were programmed in Unity, with some things composited & edited in After Effects. 

Below are my final presentation boards, with some demos sprinkled in.
