Starduster is a 2D local multiplayer head-to-head game about spring cleaning on an alien planet! One person plays as a cat-like-creature on it's mission to create chaos, and their owner, the other player, tries to stop them by whatever means necessary!

For this project I did the following:
- Created some object sprites
- Created the background from layout sketches
- Created and implemented the pulsing outline shader
- Created the particle effects as objects are damaged/cleaned
- Created and implemented the UI sprites
- Coded most of the destruction & cleaning logic
- Coded the looping world
- Implemented animations

This game was made in my own and others spare time over the course of three weeks, for the [Great Spring Game Jam 2021](https://kgeary.itch.io/starduster). [It's available for free and is a measly 40mb download, so there's no reason to not give it a try!](https://kgeary.itch.io/starduster)

In the game, you play as either Herbert (the pet), or Duster (the owner). Herbert's goal is to destroy every object he sees, while Duster's goal is to make sure that the house remains clean

If you're interested in the development of the looping world and/or outline shader, then read [this blog post](/posts/2021-03-21-starduster), and you can find all of the [source code here](https://github.com/oh-ok/Greenhouse).

We plan on slowly updating Starduster to expand on it's current gameplay and to allow for modern gaming amenities like online multiplayer and input remaping, so keep an eye out!
