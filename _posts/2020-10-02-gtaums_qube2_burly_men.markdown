The "I don't remember what happened but I guess it was okay" post

Yeah, I'm not joking, I really don't remember what happened in this game, which is strange considering the amount of critical acclaim it got at the time of its release - normally critically acclaimed indies are all about the story and experience, which makes them memorable, but clearly not with Burly Men At Sea. All I remember is the very "graphic designer"-y flat graphics, and that it only took me a few hours to complete. So yeah if you like that visual style a lot, you'll probably like this game because there isn't really much else to it (but I'm personally not that much of a fan). I remember that there's supposed to be a ton of alternate endings, but I found that I didn't really want to get them after my first playthrough, probably because the game wasn't all that much fun to play.

**Burly Men at Sea is available on Steam for PC/Mac, Playstation 4 and Nintendo Switch and I do not remember a single thing that happened in it.**

I remember slightly more about Q.U.B.E. 2 than I do Burly Men at Sea, but that's not saying much - it genuinely feels like someone from Men In Black came around and erased Burly Men at Sea from my memory. I remember that Q.U.B.E. 2's puzzles were fun and challenging, and the way that the challenge evolved as the game went on was really well well-paced, I remember that the game looked really good, and even though it went for detailed and realistic textures it still felt like it had a stylised twist on reality, which was nice. The thing's I do not remember a single thing about was the story, the soundtrack, the characters, the context of the game. I remember vague bits and bobs about aliens or something (may or may not be a spoiler, I don't know), but I know for a fact that I just kind of tuned out the story cause I just didn't really get it - and not like Observation where the story just flopped, but simply because my tiny, minuscule brain could not comprehend the twists and turns. Maybe it was just other stuff happening at the time and the story isn't that deep (which is likely), but nothing that happened sunk in at all. But hey at least I had a good time solving some cool physics puzzles. 

If I had to critique anything else, I think that the last act of the game hung around a little too long, but other than that it was pretty good as far as I remember. 

**Q.U.B.E. 2 is available on Steam for PC, Playstation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch and has some cool physics based puzzles**
