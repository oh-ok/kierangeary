So I just spent the past few hours drooling over the work of a guy you probably know called Kyle Cooper, he pretty much designs all of the good title sequences ever, but is most known for the titles he made for the David Fincher film, Se7en, which is pretty cool, but when I saw it I thought to myself, wow this reminds me a lot of the American Horror Story title sequences, and lo and behold, Kyle Cooper designed those too!
