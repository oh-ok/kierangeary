Infest The Rat's nest is King Gizzard's latest and 15th full length album, and with it comes yet another stylistic meander for the band, both visually and musically (this time it's thrash metal). So to celebrate I'm going to just go through what I like about the band. (I need to transfer the rest still) :)
