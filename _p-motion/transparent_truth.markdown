#TransparentTruth is a system and campaign for a potential Twitter fact-checking system. As I was developing this project, Twitter came out with [a different approach to fact-checking](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/birdwatch) which is more community based, however I believe that Transparent Truth would be a much better alternative from the perspective of correcting misinformation.

The idea is that fact checking organisations are already working very hard to correct viral misinformation on social media, however they are limited in how they can communicate their findings, they have to post it to their own social media/website, meaning that people won't know it's misinformation unless they're searching for the truth. #TransparentTruth makes it so that the factual accuracy is make clear before the tweet has even been viewed, so that they can still make up their own mind about what to think about a piece of information, but with the whole context upfront.
